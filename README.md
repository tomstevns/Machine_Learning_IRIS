This project is based upon a Kaggle project, primarily running online in a jupyter notebook environment.
Therefore i kindly ask my students to execute the follow steps
Start by copy the code and execute locally on PyCharm, Visual Studio .. etc IDE 
Then extend the code to save the ML-model as a *.pkl type
Then extend the code to load the ML-model and an consol-interface for entering 4 parameters for predicting one of 3 iris-species.
Lastly create a professional WEB interface for the application
Good luck !
