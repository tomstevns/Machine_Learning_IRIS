This project is based upon a Kaggle project, primarily running online in a jupyter notebook environment.
Therefore i kindly ask my students to execute the follow steps
Start by copy the code and execute locally on PyCharm, Visual Studio .. etc IDE.                                                    -->(Predic_tIris_species_001.py)
Then extend the code to save the ML-model as a *.pkl type.                                                                          -->(Predic_tIris_species_002.py)
Then extend the code to load the ML-model and an consol-interface for entering 4 parameters for predicting one of 3 iris-species.   -->(Predic_tIris_species_003.py)
Lastly create a professional WEB interface for the application.                                                                     -->(Predic_tIris_species_004.py)
Good luck !
